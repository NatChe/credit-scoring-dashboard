# Credit scoring dashboard 

The project presents the Credit Score dashboard created and hosted with Streamlit that can ve viewed at [this url](https://credit-scoring-dashboard-vo4t4kjrntvwp3fabtzsss.streamlit.app/).
The dashboard's main feature is to display, explain and simulate the client's probability to default for the current loan application.
The dashboard uses the API developed with Flask (/app) that uses the LightGBM model to make the predictions.

Different models have been tested and evaluated, the results are available in [training notebook](01_Training.ipynb).

For more details on training methodology please refer to the [Methodology Note](Methodology%20note.pdf).
